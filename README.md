These are codes i used to learn tensorflow basics. I've been using caffee and torch before and the leap from there to TF was quite fascinating.<br>Hope it helps someone else too for reference.<br>
The codes I cover are:

<br>1. Basic FC network with dropouts and L2 regularization added
<br>2. Basic Convnets
<br>3. RNN/LSTM, Bi-LSTM,dynamic rnn, etc..
<br>4. Fine Tuning Alexnet
<br>5. Different types of GANs
<br>6. Autoencoders / VAE
<br>7. Batch Normalization
<br>8. Seq2Seq models
<br>9. TF specific utils like TFRecords, Tensorboard, while_loop, dynamic calculation techniques etc.
<br>10. Deep Recurrent Attentive Writer
<br>11. Neural Turing Machine/ Differentiable Neural Computers
<br>12. Capsule Nets
<br>13. SNN/Selu
<br>14. Hierarchichal MultiScale RNN
