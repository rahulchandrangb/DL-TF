These are codes i used to learn tensorflow basics. I've been using caffee and torch before and the leap from there to TF was quite fascinating.<br>Hope it helps someone else too for reference.<br>
The codes I cover are:

1. Basic FC network with dropouts and L2 regularization added
<br>2. Basic Convnets
<br>3. RNN/LSTM
<br>4. Fine Tuning Alexnet
<br>5. Different types of GANs
<br>6. Autoencoders / VAE
<br>7. Batch Normalization
